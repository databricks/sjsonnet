/**
 * [[ValScope]]s which model the lexical scopes within a Jsonnet file that bind variable names to
 * [[Val]]s, as well as other contextual information like `self` `this` or `super`.
 *
 * Note that scopes are standalone, and nested scopes are done by copying and updating the array of
 * bindings rather than using a linked list. This is because the bindings array is typically pretty
 * small and the constant factor overhead from a cleverer data structure dominates any algorithmic
 * improvements
 *
 * The bindings array is private and only copy-on-write, so for nested scopes which do not change it
 * (e.g. those just updating `dollar0` or `self0`) the bindings array can be shared cheaply.
